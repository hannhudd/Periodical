The Periodical is a unique virtual experience allowing users to explore various menstrual products. Utilizing the passthrough and hand tracking features of the Oculus Quest 3, participants can interact with a virtual box containing five different products: a menstrual cup, disc, pad, liner, and tampon. By pressing the gold button, users can access detailed information about each product, including usage instructions, removal techniques, cost, coverage, and environmental impacts.
